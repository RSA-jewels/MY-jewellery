<h2>About Bean & Bliss</h2>
<p>Founded in the heart of Tirunelveli, Bean & Bliss was born from a love of coffee and a dream to create a space where people can relax, connect, and recharge. We believe coffee is more than a drink — it’s a ritual, a comfort, and a culture.</p>
<p>Our beans are locally roasted with care, our staff are passionate brewers, and our ambiance is designed to feel like home. Whether you're grabbing a quick espresso or spending hours with your favorite book, you belong here.</p>
